I am an Emacs man. Some may say Emacs is a kind of religion, for me I started to
be addicted in 2000 when I arrived at the ENSIMAG and a friend of mine initiated
me. 

That's very often how it works with Emacs: someone introduce it to you, give you
its personal configuration file (i.e. its .emacs) and then you start enjoy it,
eventually add your own customization and spread again the word (and your
configuration file ;) )

In all cases, Emacs remains for me the most productive environment for
developing software in almost any language and for producing LaTeX documents.    

Recently, I decided to fully restructure my config to make it more rigourous and 
understandable. Here is the result. 

---------------
 Prerequisite 
---------------

You'll need to install emacs and a few packages. 

Debian/Ubuntu: apt-get install emacs auctex emacs-goodies-el

Mac OS X: I use the Carbon emacs package available at
              http://homepage.mac.com/zenitani/emacs-e.html 

          You should also install the Enhanced Carbon EMacs (ECE) plugin
              http://www.inf.unibz.it/~franconi/mac-emacs/


---------
 Install
---------

You should move the current parent direction into your homedir (~/), rename it
to .emacs.d/ and create the symlink to the .emacs file: 

   cd
   ln -s .emacs.d/.emacs .emacs



Now a few additional packages should be installed in ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/

    - CEDET (the packaged version is too old) 
      * Get the latest version from http://sourceforge.net/projects/cedet/files/
      * Let's assume it's cedet-1.0pre6.tar.gz (the one I checked)
      * uncompress in the correct directory: 
            cd ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp
            tar xvzf /path/to/cedet-1.0pre6.tar.gz
            ln -s cedet-1.0pre6 cedet
            
      * it you're running Ubuntu 9.10, you'll need to apply the patch provided
        on http://bugs.gentoo.org/280984 and available on 
        http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/app-emacs/cedet/files/cedet-1.0_pre6-fix-eieio-comp.patch?view=markup
            patch -p0 < pathfile

      * compile cedet
            cd cedet
            make
      
   - ECB: (the packaged version is also too  old) 
     * Get the latest version from  http://ecb.sourceforge.net/
     * Assuming you retrieved ecb-x.yy.tar.gz (tested 2.40) 
	cd ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp
	tar xvzf /path/to/ecb-x.yy.tar.gz 
	ln -s ecb-x.yy ecb
	
   - (eventually) ELPA (see http://tromey.com/elpa/install.html)


----------------------------
 Configuration organization
----------------------------

~/.emacs.d/init.el          A symlink to .emacs i.e. the main configuration
                            files 
~/.emacs.d/init-defuns.el   Elisp functions definitions 
~/.emacs.d/init-display.el  Configure the display (color theme etc.)
~/.emacs.d/init-emodes.el   Configure the emacs modes
~/.emacs.d/init-cedet.el    Configure the CEDET environment
~/.emacs.d/elpa/            Directory containing the packages installed via ELPA  
~/.emacs.d/insert/          Directory that contains the templates for
                            auto-insertion
~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/       Directory containing the external elisp files used 
~/.emacs.d/themes/          Directory containing the additional color theme  

For more information, read the configurations files as I try to put relevant
information in comments.
