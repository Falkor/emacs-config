;; This code is inspired by a similar function written by Abiyu Diro.
;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This Emacs lisp file provides the function "sourcepair-load" which will load
;; the corresponding header or source file for the current buffer.  For example,
;; if you are looking at the file FooParser.cpp and enter M-x sourcepair-load 
;; (or whatever keybinding you've set), the file FooParser.h will be loaded.  
;; It also works the other way as well.  To use it put this file somewhere 
;; in your lisp library path and then add something like this to your .emacs 
;; file:
;;
;; (load-file "sourcepair.el")
;;
;; KEYBINDINGS:
;;
;; You should set a keybinding to use this function easily.  For example, I add
;; the following to my .emacs file:
;;
;; (define-key global-map "\C-xz" 'sourcepair-load)
;;
;;
;; GLOBAL VARIABLES:
;;
;; There are five global variables that can be used to adjust how the function
;; works:
;;
;; sourcepair-source-extensions :
;;
;;    A list containing the recognized extensions for source files.  By default
;;    this is set to ( ".cpp" ".cxx" ".cc" ".c" ).  For example: with the default 
;;    setting if you are looking at "foo.h", the function will look for 
;;    "foo.cpp", "foo.cxx", "foo.cc" or "foo.c" in that order in the 
;;    directories specified by sourcepair-source-path.
;;
;; sourcepair-header-extensions :
;;
;;    A list containing the recognized extensions for header files.  By default
;;    this is set to ( ".h" ".hpp" ".hh" ).  For example: with the default 
;;    setting if you are looking at "foo.cpp", the function will look for 
;;    "foo.h", "foo.hpp" or "foo.hh" in that order in the directories specified
;;    by sourcepair-header-path.
;;    
;; sourcepair-source-path :
;;
;;    A list containing the path's to search for source files.  By default this
;;    is set to ( "." ) which means source files will only be searched for in
;;    the current directory.  Paths that end in "/*" will be searched 
;;    recursively.  For example, if you specified sourcepair-source-path as
;;    ( "." "../*" ) the function will look for source files first in the 
;;    current directory, and then in the parent directory, and then in any 
;;    subdirectories of the parent directory.
;;
;; sourcepair-header-path :
;;
;;    Similar to sourcepair-source-path except for header files.
;;
;; sourcepair-recurse-ignore :
;;
;;    A list containing directories to ignore when recursively searching
;;    subdirectories for header or source files.  By default this is set
;;    to ( "CVS" )
;;
;;
;; For example, in my .emacs file I have the following:
;;
;; (setq sourcepair-source-path    '( "." "../*" ))
;; (setq sourcepair-header-path    '( "." "include" "../include" "../*"))
;; (setq sourcepair-recurse-ignore '( "CVS" "Obj" "Debug" "Release" ))
